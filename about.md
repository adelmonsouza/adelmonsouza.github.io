# About The Java Place

The Java Place is the go-to website for everything Java and Spring Boot development.

I share deep-dives and technical insights to help you take your Java development to the next level. With my passion for understanding how things work under the hood, I love exploring architecture, performance, and best practices – which I share on The Java Place. Whether you're just starting out with Spring Boot or looking to architect production-ready systems, I've got you covered.

## Who am I?

I'm **Adelmon Souza**, an Application Developer specialized in Java and Spring Boot, building scalable microservices and resilient architectures for the Cloud.

I have a passion for teaching and sharing knowledge which drives me to create content that goes beyond simple tutorials. Because I have a research mindset, _I often go deep into the nitty little details and try to push to the absolute limits to see what is possible, what is working and what is not so good_.

**I also have a passion for teaching** which I developed through my experience as a developer. Now I can continue this and share my knowledge through this blog and my GitHub projects.

I have been learning Java and Spring Boot development for several years and continue to develop my skills. Currently working as an Application Developer, I build production-ready systems and share the lessons I learn along the way.

My goal is to provide you with the tools and knowledge to successfully build and publish production-ready Java applications.

I want you to build the best possible applications that your users love and you can be proud of.

**Let's be real: There is no perfect application without bugs.** But we have to raise our standards from simple demo apps to build something amazing ⭐️.

Most online teachers in the development space talk about simple and easy demo apps. I want to go further and teach you the tools and strategies for **full production-ready applications**. _I will show you all the implementation details that I find important and necessary so that you can speed up your development process without sacrificing your application's quality and performance._

I want to help you navigate the ever-changing and evolving development world.

Stay ahead of the curve and boost your developer career. 😁

## The #30DiasJava Challenge

**Starting November 1, 2025**

Every day for 30 days, I'm building one new Java/Spring Boot project, each focusing on concepts used by BigTechs:

- **Day 1**: User-Profile-Service (Facebook/X concept) - DTOs, Spring Security, JWT
- **Day 2**: Content-Catalog-API (Netflix/Spotify concept) - Pagination, Performance
- **Day 3**: Recommendation-Engine (Amazon/Netflix concept) - Algorithms, Data Structures
- **Day 4-5**: Notification-Service (Event-Driven Architecture) - RabbitMQ, Async Communication
- **And 25 more projects...**

Each project includes full production-ready code, comprehensive tests, CI/CD, Docker, and detailed documentation.
