# About The Java Place

The Java Place is the go-to website for everything Java and Spring Boot development.

I share deep-dives and technical insights to help you take your Java development to the next level. With my passion for understanding how things work under the hood, I love exploring architecture, performance, and best practices – which I share on The Java Place. Whether you're just starting out with Spring Boot or looking to architect production-ready systems, I've got you covered.

## Who am I?

I'm **Adelmo Souza**, a Software Engineer specialized in Java and Spring Boot, building scalable microservices and resilient architectures for the Cloud.

**I have a passion for teaching and sharing knowledge** which drives me to create content that goes beyond simple tutorials. I want to provide you with the tools and knowledge to successfully build and publish production-ready Java applications.

I want you to build the best possible applications that your users love and you can be proud of.

**Let's be real: There is no perfect application without challenges.** But we have to raise our standards from simple demo projects to build something amazing ⭐️.

Most online teachers in the development space talk about simple and easy demo apps. I want to go further and teach you the tools and strategies for **full production-ready applications**. _I will show you all the implementation details that I find important and necessary so that you can speed up your development process without sacrificing your application's quality and performance._

I want to help you navigate the ever-changing and evolving development world.

Stay ahead of the curve and boost your developer career. 😁

### My Approach: Under the Hood

Because I have a research mindset, _I often go deep into the nitty little details and try to push to the absolute limits to see what is possible, what is working and what is not so good_.

This means you'll find:

- **Deep-Dives**: Understanding how Spring Boot works internally, not just how to use it
- **Performance Analysis**: Why certain architectural decisions impact performance
- **Security Deep-Dives**: Understanding vulnerabilities and how to prevent them (like Mass Assignment attacks)
- **Production-Ready Code**: Test coverage, CI/CD, Docker, and deployment strategies
- **Real-World Examples**: Projects inspired by BigTechs (Netflix, Spotify, Google, X)

## The #30DiasJava Challenge

**Starting November 1, 2025**

Every day for 30 days, I'm building one new Java/Spring Boot project, each focusing on concepts used by BigTechs:

- **Day 1**: User-Profile-Service (Facebook/X concept) - DTOs, Spring Security, JWT
- **Day 2**: Content-Catalog-API (Netflix/Spotify concept) - Pagination, Performance
- **Day 3**: Recommendation-Engine (Amazon/Netflix concept) - Algorithms, Data Structures
- **Day 4-5**: Notification-Service (Event-Driven Architecture) - RabbitMQ, Async Communication
- **And 25 more projects...**

Each project includes:
1. ✅ Full production-ready code
2. ✅ Comprehensive tests (JUnit, Testcontainers)
3. ✅ CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
4. ✅ Docker containerization
5. ✅ Detailed Business Plan (explaining the "why")
6. ✅ Deep-dive blog post (explaining "under the hood")

## Meet My Personal Project: The Java Place Blog

The Java Place is more than just a blog – it's a comprehensive resource for Java developers who want to build better applications.

**Everything you see here was fully done by me:**
- From the blog idea and design
- To the technical deep-dives and code examples
- To the GitHub Pages implementation with Jekyll

The blog has been live since November 2025, and I'm continuously adding new deep-dive articles and improving the content based on what's working in production.

### What You'll Find Here:

**📚 Technical Deep-Dives**
- How DTOs prevent security vulnerabilities
- Why pagination prevents OutOfMemoryError
- How collaborative filtering algorithms work
- Event-driven architecture patterns

**🏗️ Architecture & Design**
- Thin Controller, Fat Service pattern
- Microservices communication strategies
- Performance optimization techniques
- Testing strategies for production code

**🛠️ Tools & Practices**
- Docker & containerization
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Spring Boot best practices
- Clean Code principles

## Why I'm Building This

After working with Java and Spring Boot for several years, I realized that most tutorials and courses focus on "how to" but rarely explain "why" or "what happens under the hood."

This is where The Java Place comes in.

I want to bridge the gap between:
- **Understanding concepts** → **Applying them in production**
- **Simple examples** → **Production-ready code**
- **Surface-level knowledge** → **Deep understanding**

My goal is to help you become a better Java developer by understanding not just what to do, but **why you're doing it** and **how it works internally**.
