## Example: Day 2 - Content Catalog API (SUCCESS MODEL)

```
🚀 Day 2/30 of #30DiasJava: Efficient Pagination - How I Prevented OutOfMemoryError

So I've been diving into performance optimization lately, and it's been quite the journey. I wanted to share what I learned about how simple design decisions can have dramatic impacts on memory usage and scalability.

**What I built today:**
Content-Catalog-API: A content catalog service inspired by Netflix/Spotify with Spring Boot 3.2+, PostgreSQL, and efficient pagination.

**Why this matters:**
Many production applications crash with OutOfMemoryError because they load millions of records into memory at once. Understanding pagination isn't just about "best practices" – it's about understanding how databases work under the hood.

**Under the Hood:**
When you call `repository.findAll()`, Hibernate loads every single record into memory. With 1 million records, that's 500 MB per request. Spring Data JPA's `Pageable` transforms this into optimized SQL with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`, loading only 20 records at a time. The difference? 99.998% less memory and 50-100x faster.

**Key takeaway:**
Performance isn't something that just happens automatically – you really have to work for it, and architectural choices can either make that easier or much harder.
